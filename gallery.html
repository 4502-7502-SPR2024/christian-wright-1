      <h1>Emily Wright, Owner of Three Creeks Farm</h1>
      <p>Emily Wright and her partner Paul Weber both own Three Creeks Farm, a four-acre farm in Ashland, Mo.  

“I did not anticipate on being a farmer, I anticipated on moving to the city when I was younger,” Emily said.  

Three Creeks Farm is a small farm that grows flowers, herbs, vegetables, trees, and other plants.  Three Creeks mainly sells their products to local grocery stores, restaurants, chefs, and florists.  All their produce is grown without the use of synthetic pesticides and fertilizers.  Emily and Paul bought the land that Three Creeks is currently on in 2020.  

“It was important that our land was close to Columbia because it doesn’t make sense driving far to deliver fresh produce,” Emily said.  

Emily has worked on farms in Italy, Mexico, and across the United States in states like New Mexico, Washington, and Connecticut.  Emily was born in Denver, but moved to Missouri since her father is from Huntsville, Mo.  Emily works on the farm nearly every day to keep it running.  

When searching for properties, Emily and Paul struggled to purchase land because the properties kept going so quick.  One person directly reached out to them stating that they had generational land for sale.

“This land we got because the owner specifically reached out to us because they wanted their land to be an organic farm,” Emily said.
